# Hi, I'm Luna ✌🏽
_Passionate about creating cool things and brewing the perfect cup!_


## Who am I? 🤔

Welcome to my digital coffee shop—grab a cup and let's code!

I'm Luna, a curly-haired developer trying to make it through life one bug at a time... just kidding! When I'm not coding, I like to play music, skate, and perfect my coffee brewing techniques! I believe coding is an art form, and every bug is just a puzzle waiting to be solved! 🎨🧩

## ☕ My Dev Blend

```ruby
module LunasCoffeeCode
  # The daily grind ☕
  FAVORITE_BREWS = {
    backend: %w[Ruby Rails PostgreSQL],
    frontend: %w[Tailwind Stimulus Turbo],
    version_control: :git
  }

  # Past blends I've experimented with 📚
  PAST_BREWS = {
    languages: %w[C++ PHP Java JavaScript],
    frameworks: %w[Laravel SpringBoot Bootstrap],
    databases: :MySQL,
    tools: ['Azure DevOps', 'Scrum/Agile']
  }

  # My brewing philosophy ✨
  BREWING_STYLE  =  {
    daily_practice: "Pair programming with awesome teammates",
    approach: "Clean code over messy spills",
    environment: "Agile, with a splash of fun",
    mindset: "Every bug is a mystery flavor waiting to be solved" 
  }
end

```
