- 👋 Hi, I’m @MrLuna12 
- 📖 After learning a little bit of JavaScript a couple of years ago, I decided to change careers and study computer science.
- 🎓 I'm working on my Master of Computer Science.
- 👨🏽‍💻 I’m interested in becoming a software engineer.
- 📚 I’m currently learning about AI and Web Apps with Laravel
- 🤓 I’m looking forwarding to learning as much as possible. One of the things that drew me to the field was the long-life commitment to learning. Technology is always evolving, and there's always something new to learn!
